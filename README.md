# Linear-supports
Calculating stresses in steel sections using sectionproperties, and check compliance with design RCC-M Z VI.
Main steel sections library included (french / europeean steel sections)

Criterias similar to AISC Allowable Stress Design 9th / ASME III NF (without single angle appendix).
Stress limit for U sections in bending may be lower than the criteria.

Program is provided without responsabilities on results.
Some checks were done using available results from RSTAB + ASD.
